<h1>Iris Species Classifier using Decision Tree</h1>

<p>This project is a machine learning model that classifies the species of iris flowers using a <strong>Decision Tree Classifier</strong>. The classifier has been trained on the famous <strong>Iris Dataset</strong> and achieves an accuracy of <strong>97%</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset for classification problems in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sepal length</li>
    <li>Sepal width</li>
    <li>Petal length</li>
    <li>Petal width</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to predict the species of the iris flower based on these four features. There are three species in the dataset:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Iris Setosa</li>
    <li>Iris Versicolor</li>
    <li>Iris Virginica</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Description</h2>
<p>We have used a <strong>Decision Tree Classifier</strong> from the <code>scikit-learn</code> library to train this model. The model has achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset. Below is an example of how the model can be used to classify iris species.</p>

<h3>Libraries Used</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.7+</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>numpy</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Load the Iris Dataset</h2>
<p>The Iris dataset is available in <code>scikit-learn</code>'s datasets module. You can load it easily using the following Python code:</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier to classify iris species with high accuracy. By leveraging the <code>scikit-learn</code> library and the Iris dataset, we can build a model that is both interpretable and highly effective in solving classification problems.</p>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>
    <p>The accuracy of this model is 97% and for more observation check my <strong>"Notebooks\Decision Tree Classifier (Iris Dataset).ipynb" </strong></p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Try experimenting with different classifiers like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines (SVM).</li>
    <li>Use cross-validation to further validate the model performance.</li>
    <li>Optimize the Decision Tree parameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) using grid search or random search techniques.</li>
</ul>
